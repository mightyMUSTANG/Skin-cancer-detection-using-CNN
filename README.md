AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO DETECT SKIN CANCER USING CNN 📌 Overview Skin cancer is among the most prevalent forms of cancer, and early identification can significantly improve treatment success. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant based on image inputs. The objective is to create an efficient, accurate, and automated detection system to assist medical professionals.

🛠️ Technologies Used Python TensorFlow/Keras – Deep learning framework OpenCV – Image processing NumPy, Pandas – Data handling Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization Streamlit – Web application for deployment

🔍 Dataset Details The dataset consists of labeled images of different types of skin lesions. The images undergo preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.

📖 Key Features ✔ AI-powered classification of skin lesions ✔ Image preprocessing for enhanced accuracy ✔ Interactive web-based interface using Streamlit ✔ High precision and recall for early detection.
📊 Model Architecture The CNN architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers – Extracts essential features from images ReLU Activation – Introduces non-linearity Pooling Layers – Reduces feature map dimensions Flatten & Fully Connected Layers – Processes extracted features Softmax Layer – Generates final predictions
